/* Q: What is the syntax of an if/else statement in JavaScript? */

if (condition) {
    // code to be executed if the condition is true
} else {
    // code to be executed if condition is false
}

/* The "condition" is an expression that is evaluted to either "true" 
or "false". The code inside the curly braces "{}" following the "if" 
keyword will be executed if the "condition" is true, and the code inside 
the curly braces following the "else" keyword will be executed if the condition is false. */
