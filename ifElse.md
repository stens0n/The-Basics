Q: What is the syntax of an if/else statement in JavaScript?

A: if (condition) {
    // code to be executed if the condition is true
} else {
    // code to be executed if condition is false
}

The "condition" is an expression that is evaluted to either "true" or "false". The code inside the curly braces "{}" following the "if" keyword will be executed if the "condition" is true, and the code inside the curly braces following the "else" keyword will be executed if the condition is false.

Q: How do you check for multiple conditions in an if/else statement?

A: Use the "&&" (and) or "||" (or) operator. For ex, to check if a variable "x" is greater than 0 and less than 10:

if (x > 0 && x < 10) {
    // code to be executed if x is greater than 0 and less than 10
} else {
    // code to be executed if x is not greater than 0 and less than 10
}


You can also us multiple "if/else if" statements to check for multiple conditions:

if (x > 0 && x < 5) {
    //code to be executed if x is greater than 0 and less than 5
} else if (x >= 5 && x < 10) {
    //code to be executed if x is greater than or equal to 5 and less than 10
} else {
    // code to be executed if x is not greater than 0 and less than 10 
}
